# PureJavascriptCalculator


<p>
In this small project I have constructed this calculator dynamically using only javascript.
the main file here is app.js.
the index.html contains only html skeleton, rest all the things are appended dynamically using javascript.
</p>
I have also tried providing proper comments for easy understanding.
